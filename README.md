# WEKA
A simple method for recording the actions of multiple teams for each turn in a matrix-based wargaming exercise. 
It was designed to function as a live document, updating for all players and facilitators in realtime through collaborative software. It is also adaptable for clientside usage, and for pen-and-paper formats.
